OilLevelReader
==============

OpenCV based oil meter level reader for Raspberry Pi

Uses a picamera and openCV on a Raspberry PI for reading an analog dial meter of an home heating oil tank.
The angle of the needle is determined and converted to a percentage full for the tank

The number can then be logged or sent to an openHAB server for logging and other events.
